 <p>&emsp;&emsp;"The world is facing a major breakthrough, a new technology revolution have accelerated in the international division of labor system evolution, One Belt And One Road for the internationalization of China's future laid a good platform, as well as robot enterprises in China provides a good opportunity go out. So we need to integrate all kinds of top-level design and resources to form an international market together, rather than simply going out individually." Qu daokui, founder and President of xinsong robot automation co., LTD., made the comments on One Belt And One Road, a theme of the world robot conference in 2017.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;With the deepening of One Belt And One Road, more and more domestic and foreign enterprises are participating. There are enterprises of engineering machinery and equipment manufacturing, trade and financial enterprises, and technological innovation frontier enterprises represented by the robot industry.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;In Beijing by letter appoint zhang boxu, director of point of view, with the deepening of the innovation driven development strategy implementation, to enhance China's comprehensive strength, continue to improve innovation ability, the robot industry achieved rapid development. "In recent years, China's industrial robot sales annual growth as high as 35%, industrial robot production 72000 units in 2016, make up about a quarter of the world, speech recognition, image recognition, reached the international advanced level, controller, servo motor, such as a major breakthrough in key parts, China made some advantages in the field of robot parts, are marching to the robot application powers to innovation power."</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;Not only that, according to zhang boxu, only in Beijing, for example, in 2025 Beijing robot industry revenue is expected to reach 60 billion yuan of above, the formation of the world's leading robotics collaborative innovation system, artificial intelligence and so on frontier reached world leading level, reached the international advanced level, operating systems and software basic robot built the world's leading innovative application base.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;"With such a large market, it is bound to lead to greater development of the industry." Xin guobin, vice minister of industry and information technology, said.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;According to sun lining, dean of the school of mechanical and electrical engineering of suzhou university, some new requirements should also be generated as the strength of our industrialization process increases. "Area exists all the way to the transformation of our country's demand for equipment automation and artificial intelligence, if we can seize the breakthrough point, well drive the output of the transfer of industry and technology is of great opportunity."</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;Qu daokui, founder and President of xinsong robot automation co., LTD. He said One Belt And One Road provided a very good platform for the globalization of Chinese enterprises, enabling Chinese robot enterprises to move quickly to the international arena.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;According to Qu xinsong has made a lot of efforts in this area. "One Belt And One Road has both developed and diverse corporate clients, and it has actually formed the output of One Belt And One Road's vast number of technologies, products and projects. Including uzbekistan and Russia, the United States, Canada, India, Malaysia and other countries have our products, both industrial robots and mobile robot, and our complete system solutions.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;"In addition, we have tried to make a new robot that makes robots fully digital." Siasun dao-kui qu, "the future of this new intelligent manufacturing model also can completely copy directly to the area of different countries, all the way to make smart, factory inspection, processing and certification can form a whole different links such as going out."</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;It is understood that the current siasun company is with Israel in guangzhou to build a research institute, the researchers plan to develop a new innovation platform, combined closely with different associations in abroad at the same time, set up in the face of a new generation of all kinds of standard system of the robot.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;Similar cooperation is not unusual. According to VitalyNedelskiy, President of the Russian federation of robots, in June 2016, China and Russia jointly built a medical robot center in China and engaged in research, design, software development and production. We will work more with Chinese partners, including Chinese medical institutions.</p>

 <p>&emsp;&emsp;VitalyNedelskiy said that Russia is very willing to cooperate with China further in the field of robotics to jointly develop the global robot market.</p>
