			<p>&emsp;&emsp;"China is entering a new and complex stage of development. China has emerged from a humble role in the 1970s as a powerful member of the international arena.
China's role in the global economy and international relations will continue to expand. Despite its size, China is still a developing country. The Communist Party of China will face numerous policy challenges.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Two key issues facing the Chinese communist party are its role in the Asia Pacific region and Karl. The ideological legacy of Karl Marx. The CPC is carrying out in-depth research and thinking on these two issues.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;If the west wants to better understand China, it needs to understand the depth of its political system and the breadth of its ongoing debate.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;When chairman MAO Zedong died in 1976, China was Mired in extreme poverty and insignificant in the global economy. In December 1978, the third plenary session of the 11th CPC central committee began to establish the general policy of "reform and opening up" China's economy under the leadership of the communist party of China. Few people outside of China believed it would succeed.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;In late 1989, the socialist system collapsed throughout eastern Europe. In February 1990, the Soviet communist party officially ended its 70-year reign in the Soviet union; In December 1991, the Soviet union ceased to exist and dissolved into multiple sovereign states. After a series of incidents in 1989 and eastern Europe and the Soviet union in 1989 and 1991, the west generally assumed that the communist regime would not exist in China for much longer.
Moreover, the western consensus is that the history of these socialist camps, from democratic Germany to Vietnam, shows that it is impossible for communist party leaders to "transition" to market economies. According to this repeated argument, "regime change" is a necessary condition for running a market economy. Whether the "Washington consensus" of international institutions policy recommendations, or western politicians and media, almost unanimously in the whole western thought: the rule of the communist party in China will not continue, even one thousand survive, also can't afford to build a successful market economy.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;It has been a quarter of a century since 1989, 1990, and it seems that the situation is very different from what was widely expected and expected in the west. After the collapse of the Soviet union, the communist party in China did not follow suit. The "regime change" that many still hope and work for has not happened. The communist party of China, which has 87 million members, will mark the centenary of the party's founding in 2021. The communist party led China to achieve the most remarkable growth and development in modern history. Under the umbrella of political stability, China has maintained a rapid growth rate of 30 years. The Chinese government as a whole layout lasting huge infrastructure projects, including roads, railways, ports, airports, DAMS, electricity power facilities, telecommunication, water supply and drainage system and housing; It is far more than comparable developing countries, such as India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Bangladesh.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;China's reform has gradually expanded market competition to most areas of the economy. Through careful experiment reform path, "feel the stone river", gradually change the system, so that the people gradually adapt to the transition from the state-owned economy to the market economy. The process of gradual experimentation also allows policy makers to solve problems one by one, while maintaining a grasp of the overall path of institutional reform. These reforms unleashed the productivity of local companies and attracted investment from most of the world's leading companies, enabling China to rapidly absorb advanced technology and gain a huge "backwardness advantage".</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Based on Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) calculations, China now has the world's largest gross domestic product. China is the world's largest international trade. China has the world's largest manufacturing output, a third more than the us, and more than France, Germany, Japan and Britain combined. Since the 1980s, China's poverty rate has fallen sharply, and virtually all social groups have significantly improved their living standards.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Despite the strides made, China still faces significant policy challenges as it tries to turn low-income countries into high-income countries.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Has a large number of literature on these challenges, including an aging population, rural surplus labor force depletion, corruption, severe environmental pollution, low level of independent innovation, local companies low status in the global competition, differences in income and wealth disparities, the international hostile environment and so on. Using purchasing power parity (PPP) there are still many practical problems, not only because of the developed countries and developing countries there are differences between the quality of goods and services, but also because to get the global prices of goods and services. Although statisticians have made great efforts, it is widely believed that PPP tends to overestimate the GDP of developing countries.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;In November 2013, the 18th session of the central committee of the Communist Party of China held the third plenary session through "the central committee of the Communist Party of China on comprehensively deepen reform certain major issue decision" (hereinafter referred to as "decision"), and pointed out the global properties of these challenges, outlined the roadmap of the next stage reform of the system (communism Party of China, 2013). "Decision" reiterated the need to pay attention to the reform of "systematic, holistic, collaborative", "speed up the development of the socialist market economy, democratic politics, the advanced culture and harmonious society, ecological civilization"; Stressing that the market should "play a decisive role in resource allocation", the government should "drastically reduce" its role in resource allocation. It should continue to study how to "manage the relationship between government and the market". The decision emphasizes that the construction of a "socialist market economy with Chinese characteristics" needs "to promote social equity and justice and promote the well-being of the people as the starting point and the foothold".</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;To achieve these goals, the decision stresses China's need to "reform the income distribution system, promote common prosperity", and ensure "equalization of basic public services". Also emphasized the need to "deepening the reform of political system," and "adhere to the leadership of the party" - "to build socialism country under the rule of law, the development of more extensive and more fully and more healthy people's democracy". The decision describes China entering a "new phase" in which reforms are in the "deep water zone". At this stage, China "faces a difficult choice" and needs to "get on the beach". In order to overcome the multiple challenges, the party needs to "break the bondage of stereotypes" "seeking truth from facts" "emancipate the mind", also need to be "practical" "everything from set out actually" "summarizes domestic successful practices, draw lessons from the beneficial experience of abroad".</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;China's relative importance in the global economy has gradually returned to its pre-industrial position, bringing profound issues to China's international relations.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;From the han dynasty (202-220 BC) to two thousand years from the late 18th century, China was the most advanced and technologically advanced place in the world. For most of that period, China had deep commercial and cultural ties with central Asia and eastern and southern coastal states. "Tributary system" is the diplomatic symbol of these relations, and the first article explores the historical evidence of these relationships. Through deep business dealings with the surrounding region, China's technology has not only spread to these regions, but also to Europe. Many of the key technologies of the industrial revolution originated in China.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;In the wake of the industrial revolution, relations between the west and the asia-pacific region have changed dramatically. Britain replaced China as the workshop of the world over a century and a half. This economic revolution laid the foundation for the army and naval revolution, enabling the west to build a vast colonial empire.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;The decision by the CPC central committee has identified the silk road economic belt and the maritime silk road as the core strategy for China's next phase of international relations. China can make great contribution to the development of the silk road in central Asia and southeast Asia.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;This is not only for the construction and the silk road economic belt and the maritime silk road the harmonious relation between neighboring countries has brought great hope, in fact also European Renaissance offers prospects, because China can take advantage of abundant financial and human capital reserves, participate in and promote the development of the "neighbourhood" all the way along the route area.
