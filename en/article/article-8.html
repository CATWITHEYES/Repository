<p>&emsp;&emsp;Beijing, Guangxi news on May 13 (Xinhua Zhi Xiong Yang Yan-Mei Huang) "in the implementation of the 'initiatives, all the way to the enterprise" go out "bring greater opportunities, overseas markets has become an important fulcrum enterprise restructuring, transfer way." Jin Ningyun, chairman of Guangxi construction industry group, said in an interview with xinxin.com on June 13 that the amount of overseas contracts that the company has undertaken in recent years has exceeded 10 billion Yuan. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Guangxi construction industry group is a large state-owned construction and installation enterprise, is one of the key support enterprises in Guangxi "100 billion yuan enterprise engineering". Jeannin transport is introduced, in recent years, the group with the aid of national favorable opportunity of the construction of the "region", has carried out the sugar in southeast Asian and African countries installation construction, project contracting, construction machinery exports, international trade and other business, become the advanced manufacturing industry in Guangxi examples of "going out".</p> 

<p>&emsp;&emsp;"This bag of sugar is a microcosm of 'One Belt And One Road' international production capacity cooperation." Jinning took up a bag of white sugar to introduce to the reporter, this bag of white sugar is made in Thailand with Chinese technology + Thai sugarcane. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;According to introducing, in 2011, Guangxi construction group, the first installation company in EPC general contracting mode to undertake the Thai Wu tai he sugar mill project, this is Chinese contractors in Thailand in EPC general contracting mode construction of the first modern sugar mill, Thailand's first in EPC general contracting mode of foreign contract projects.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;The actual construction cycle of the above projects lasted just 430 days, creating the fastest pace of construction of Thailand's type sugar refinery. After the production, the sugar factory has been ranked the top of the more than 50 sugar factories in Thailand. In 2014, the project was awarded the China construction engineering luban prize (overseas project), and became the first overseas EPC sugar factory to build the lu ban award project. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;With the brand benefit established by the project, the company has successively implemented EPC projects in Thailand's Kwan-Wu li and Thailand's Lat Takeshi. In 2016, the company signed a new three sugar factory EPC project with a contract amount of nearly 2 billion Yuan. In June, the company will also sign a contract with Japan's mitsui logistics co., LTD., to build a contract for Thailand's KSP sugar factory, which is to be the most advanced sugar refinery in the world.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;This year, the Ethiopian OMO2 sugar plant project, which is the first in Africa to be implemented by Guangxi construction industry group, has been put into operation. The sugar factory was able to produce the first batch of raw sugar after 78 hours of sugarcane, creating the record of the shortest and fastest production of the Ethiopian sugar plant. The speed and quality of "made in China" is highly valued by the industry and highly appreciated by the government of Ethiopia. The country's leaders have inspected the project two times and have made it a key project to host foreign heads of state.</p> 

<p>&emsp;&emsp;"The sugar factory projects we have implemented overseas have led to local sugarcane cultivation and land development and utilization, providing a lot of employment opportunities for the local economy and promoting the development of the local economy. At the same time, it also effectively avoids overseas labor risks, reduces the cost of labor cost and achieves a good result of win-win cooperation. The group is committed to creating a world-class benchmarking company for sugar production lines, said Jinning.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;The One Belt And One Road initiative is an opportunity for the world and also for Chinese companies. The vivid practice of "going out" of Guangxi construction industry group is a successful example of Guangxi enterprises in deepening international production capacity cooperation under the great wave of supply-side structural reform. </p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Liuzhou is an important industrial city in Guangxi, and it is also the closest emerging auto city to ASEAN, and the results of the city's car companies "go to sea" are highlighted. Liuzhou official introduction, foreign investment growth for three consecutive years in the city, 2016 enterprises to apply for foreign investment projects successfully 14, foreign investment new hit a record $350 million, up 37.65% from a year earlier, ranked second in the 14 cities in Guangxi.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;As the world's top 50 engineering machinery enterprises liugong group co., LTD., one of the 178 international dealers and overseas business covers the basic layout of countries along the "area", and established the manufacturing plants in India, Poland, Brazil, overseas sales accounted for a third of the total sales revenue.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;As we have learned, at present, the "going out" of large state-owned backbone enterprise in Guangxi, cooperation method is from the original simple import and export trade, development to the investment, joint venture, cross-border M&A, foreign contracted projects, strategic alliance, and other forms of investment to expand to the industry, the development and utilization of mineral resources, many aspects, such as infrastructure construction, investment region also from Hong Kong and ASEAN countries, expand to Europe, Africa.</p> 

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Guangxi private enterprises also actively participated in the construction of "One Belt And One Road", North America, Europe, Africa, Oceania and South America, covering 46 countries and regions. Among them, the number of projects in countries along the One Belt And One Road is 83.6%. </p>
