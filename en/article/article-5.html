<p>&emsp;&emsp;The charm of The Belt And  Road is the charm of China's modernization and the charm of China's reform and opening-up. This is the first time that the author has participated in the theme of "getting rid of poverty and common development" at the headquarters of the African union, and the experience of the high-level dialogue and the BBS of the think tank of china-africa poverty reduction.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;After 38 years of reform and opening up, China has lifted more than 700 million people out of poverty and made up 70 percent of the UN's millennium development goals. This is the most direct incentive for many developing countries to actively integrate into "One Belt And One Road" in accordance with China's initiatives. It's hard to industrialize without infrastructure; Without industrialization, democratization is doomed to failure.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Of the 1.1 billion people in Africa, 400 million are poor and 500 million have not yet had access to electricity. Industrialization has not started or is in the primary stage, and China is very important to China's "to get rich and build the road first. To be rich, to build fast; To rich, through the Internet "experience, the positive response to China's" three nets ", in the African construction of high-speed highway, high-speed railway network, regional aviation network, infrastructure, industrialization, from the docking "neighbourhood" all the way to see the hope of industrialization, agricultural modernization, to push through the 2030 United Nations sustainable development agenda.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;"Area" in the new era to implement open, inclusive and balanced, Pratt & Whitney, sustainable globalization, advocate the world development imbalances, debris segmentation market connectivity, form the cooperation framework of equality, transverse, solve the multinational company's global division of labor for the developing countries to developed countries and opening up, one way or is mainly produced by the globalization of the link between the developed countries of injustice, uneven development issues; We have promoted the synergy of strategies, linking developed countries, developing countries and emerging countries with the broadest possible links, and truly realized the integration of east and west, China and the world.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Chairman Mr Xi said, I put forward the "area" initiative in 2013, it is the core content of promote the construction of infrastructure and connectivity, docking national policy and development strategy, deepen pragmatic cooperation and promote the coordination and linkage development, realize common prosperity.
Infrastructure, connectivity, strategic alignment, international production capacity and equipment manufacturing cooperation, coordinated development, this is why "One Belt And One Road" is the key word.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Take the infrastructure as an example. It can be said that the construction of One Belt And One Road has led to the development of the world economy. The world bank statistics show that in the developing world now infrastructure invested about $1 trillion a year, but if you want to keep the present economic growth and meet the needs of the future, estimates that by 2020 still need to increase at least $1 trillion a year. The world is expected to need about $57 trillion in infrastructure investment by 2030. According to the former world bank senior vice President Justin yifu Lin, professor's depiction of the model, developing countries every $1 increase infrastructure investment, will increase the import of $0.7, $0.35 of them are from developed countries. Global infrastructure investment will increase the export of developed countries and create a space for structural reform.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;In "supermap", American connor argues that the infrastructure spending of the next 40 years will be more than 4,000 years old! The tariff reduction in traditional globalization will drive the world economy up to 5 percent, and the connectivity in a new type of globalization will boost the world economy by 10-15 percent. Thus, "One Belt And One Road" gives a stronger impetus to globalisation. Bloomberg believes that by 2050, "One Belt And One Road" will add 3 billion middle class and revitalize the region that accounts for 80 percent of the world economy.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Through the connectivity of infrastructure, "One Belt And One Road" is treating the new liberal globalization, directing hot money to the real economy and eliminating the source of the global financial crisis. Not only that, "One Belt And One Road" has become an important cooperative initiative for the international community to achieve the UN 2030 sustainable development goals, and let globalisation benefit a wider population. The initiative to explore the construction of the global energy Internet, and to promote clean and green ways to meet global electricity demand, is the best and most apt example.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Infrastructure connectivity fully demonstrates China's new comparative advantages. China power grid in the iron base ", day, armed, human-computer interaction, all interconnected and other traditional and emerging infrastructure areas, from design, construction, operation, management, capital, technology, talent and so on each link, all has the incomparable advantage.  	</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Behind it is the industry of China's powerful state-owned enterprises, the Chinese wisdom and integrated embodiment of its overall coordination ability and "One Belt And One Road" advocated the three-dimensional traffic network connectivity, build the armed "four one" pattern, the railway port trade "five one" the development of the situation, make up for the private capital in the west cannot and will not invest in market is not mature national infrastructure gap.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;Confucius said, "he who wants to stand up, he wants to become a man of his own." China has received a huge boost from the last round of Globalisation and the industrialization of Asia. China-Pakistan economic corridor along the "area" is the flagship of the corridor, on China's industry chain extension, help realize industrialization, and to develop and promote safety, establish western propaganda "failed state" as an emerging country, strengthen the "four confidence", life offset the western mode of Indian democracy, highlight chairman xi "area" is put forward by the "Asian boom two wings", "connectivity is its blood meridian" thinking.</p>

<p>&emsp;&emsp;In a word, "One Belt And One Road" financing, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign connection, north and south, east and west, seize the development as a solution to all problems always key, hold key infrastructure interconnectivity, reveal "government + market" two-wheel drive the Chinese model of charm, is cracking the problem of poverty, the gap between rich and poor and governance. This is a fundamental reason why it attracts more and more countries. From this perspective, One Belt And One Road is undoubtedly an unprecedented project of the contemporary world.</p>
